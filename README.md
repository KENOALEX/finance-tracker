# 🐍 My Python Journey: Expense Tracker

Hi there! 👋  

I decided to get serious about learning Python this year. Instead of doing a bunch of random "Hello World" tutorials, I'm building one real project and upgrading it as I get better. 

This project is an **Expense Tracker**. 

Right now, it's pretty basic, but the plan is to keep refactoring and adding features until I have a full-stack application. I'm using this repo to track my progress from "Beginner" to "Master."

## 🗺️ The Plan
I've broken my learning path into stages. I'll check these off as I complete them:

- [x] **v1: The Basics** - Just a simple script to calculate a budget.
- [ ] **v2: Saving Data** - Adding CSV handling so my data doesn't disappear when I close the app.
- [ ] **v3: Cleaning Up** - Organizing the code into functions and fixing error bugs.
- [ ] **v4: OOP Update** - Rewriting the logic using Classes and Objects (getting fancy).
- [ ] **v5: Real Database** - Moving from CSV files to SQL (SQLite).
- [ ] **v6: Visuals** - Using Pandas and Matplotlib to make charts of my spending.
- [ ] **v7: Going Web** - Turning this script into a website using Flask/Django.
- [ ] **v8: The Final Polish** - Hosting it online and adding automation.

## 💻 How to try it
If you want to see where I'm at right now:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `python main.py`
